    "At the top of your python code, load Pandas like this:\n",
    "```py\n",
    "import pandas as pd\n",

    "## Pandas Vocab\n",
    "\n",
    "- The key object in the pandas library is that you put data into **dataframes**, which are like Excel spreadsheets\n",
    "- Variables are in columns (which have a **name** that identifies the column)\n",
    "- Observations are in rows (which have an **index** that identifies the row)\n",
    "    - _In our \"Golden Rules\" chapter we used the term \"key\" (which I prefer), but pandas uses Index._\n",
    "- If you create an object with a single variable, pandas might store it as a **series** object\n",
    "- **\"Wide data\"** vs. **\"Long data\"**: See the [next section](#The-shape-of-data)"
