    "We start our machine learning applications with regression for a few simple reasons:\n",
    "- Regression is fundamental method for estimating the relationship between a variable (\"y\") that condition on many (\"X\") variables. \n",
    "- But the coefficients obtained can also be used to generate predictions. \n",
    "- _Note: The focus in this section is on RELATIONSHIP paradigm_\n",
    "- Many issues that confront researchers have well understood solutions when regression is the model being used. \n",
    "- Regression coefficients are easy to interpret.\n"
