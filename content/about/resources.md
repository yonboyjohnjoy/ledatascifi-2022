```

```{dropdown} Visualization
- **Essential:** [Kaggle's Data viz tutorial](https://www.kaggle.com/residentmario/welcome-to-data-visualization) is excellent. It has reproducible code and data, using python.
- **Essential:** [An Economist's Guide to Visualizing Data](https://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/pdf/10.1257/jep.28.1.209) is excellent as well.
- **Essential:** [Data Visualization: A practical introduction, by Kieran Healy](https://socviz.co/lookatdata.html#lookatdata) especially discusses the "whys" of visualization in a smart way. The walkthroughs are in R, not python, however.
- [STAT545 on good visualization](https://stat545.com/effective-graphs.html)

You could start trying [to analyze it here](http://drivendata.co/blog/worldbank-poverty-benchmark/). This has a good example of the process you might follow. After you're done, you can see [the winner's code and discussion of the winning approach](https://github.com/drivendataorg/pover-t-tests/tree/9a1918856c5e6ee537caed103eb80dabefb2fe44)
