    "\n",
    "In the picture below, I’ve split the project into two sub-directories: \"build\" (whose function is to build the sample from the raw data inputs) and \"analysis\". These are two-sub tasks of any data project, and here, I've chosen to treat them as different functions and thus they get different folders (**Rule 3.A**).\n",

    "## Folders separated by function - part 2\n",
    " \n",
    "The build folder takes \"inputs\", which are processed by files inside \"code\", and places the analysis sample (now explicitly created!) in \"output\". Notice the inputs and outputs are clearly separated! (**Rule 3.B**) Temp files are created along the way, but are not \"output\".\n",
    "\n",
    "![](img/dir-build.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Also, notice the new file `run_directory.py`.** It very quickly and plainly documents how to run the entire code in the \"build\" project (**Rule 1.B**), and makes it easy to do so every time (**Rule 2.B**) before you push it back to the master repo on GitHub (**Rule 2.A**). `run_directory.py` is so simple, it is self-documenting (**Rule 6.C**).\n",
